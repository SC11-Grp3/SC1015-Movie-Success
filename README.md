## Introduction
***
This is a Mini-Project for NTU Course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) 2022. In this project, we will showcase if a movie's success can be determined by various factors. The dataset we will be using is [**The Movies Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

*'Success' definition - Generated revenue is higher than budget spent to produce the movie*
