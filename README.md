## Introduction
***
This is a Mini-Project for NTU Course SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) 2022. In this project, we will showcase if a movie's success can be determined by various factors. The dataset we will be using is [**The Movies Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

*'Success' definition - Generated revenue is higher than budget spent to produce the movie*

## Problem Definition
***
1. Can a movie's success be determine by the following factors:
 1. Pre-Elements variables
 2. Post-Element variables
 3. Pre & Post Element Variables
2. Which model would be the best to predict?

## Models Used
***
1. Linear Regression
2. XGBoost Algorithm

## Conclusion
***
A movie's success cannot be determine solely on pre-production and post-production elements alone. But it is likely possible that it can be determined using a combination of both factors. Hence, a combination of both marketing and production resources are key to creating a vibrant and engaging movie.  

A successful movie can be made with little budget and lesser known cast and crew e.g. SAW(2004), Rocky(1976). Thus pre-production elements is not a strong indicator.

An unsuccessful movie can still happen even with high budget, popularity and well renowned cast, e.g. Transformers: The Last Knight(2017), The Mummy(2017)
